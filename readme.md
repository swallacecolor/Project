My project is an website that allows users to add contacts and create a text message, assign it a date and time to be sent and this will be sent using the Twilio API to the user. 
MVP:
User can create an account and then login and access their dashboard.
On dashboard they can view upcoming messages, edit and delete those messages
They can select New Message to draft a new message
They can select contacts to be taken to the contacts screen and view, edit and Delete their contacts
They can also logout and their information will be saved only in their file

Nice to have:
View past messages (no edit or delete)
View message state (sent, bounced, etc)
Incorporate a calendar or pop up so they can select the date
